Please place your logo file here as `logo.png`.

Steps:
1. Save the attached PNG image from the chat as `logo.png`.
2. Put the file at `public/logo.png` in the project root.
3. Restart the dev server (if running) or refresh the page; the header will load `/logo.png` automatically.

Recommended: use a square PNG around 200x200 or smaller; Tailwind classes will scale it to fit the header.
